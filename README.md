**PROJECT PROPOSAL**

**Net IDs**
The NetIDs working on this project are pbromen2.
Since this is a solo project I will be the captain.

**Theme: 5 - Free Topic**
Using LLMs and Textual Analysis to build an application to create Minnesota expungement legal  paperwork.

**What is the task?**
The task is to create an application that will take user supplied data and create a first draft paperwork needed to file an expungement case with the state of Minnesota. This documentation will then be reviewed by a lawyer before being filed with the courts.

**Is it novel?**
While many are working on using LLMs in the legal space, I believe this project to be a novel application of recent text analysis and processing breakthroughs.

**Why is it important or interesting?**
Expungement is the process of getting low level arrests and convictions off of a personâ€™s record. It has come into focus as a key social justice/equity need as contact in the legal systems prevents many groups from reaching their full potential.

I have partnered with a lawyer and former classmate, and we believe that by combining LLMs with other APIs I can create a tool that will reduce the amount of work expungements required by as much as 70%.

**What is your planned approach?**
My planned approach is to create 
flow map of the current process
Determine which elements questions are suitable for LLMs and which are more suitable for traditional programming.
Code basic internal facing front end
Create a client facing form for user information input
Use Python and API services to create form template and fill in basic paperwork fields
Engineer prompts and API calls to turn user information to answer paperwork questions in a legal voice.
Q/A system with lawyer
Connect to mail sending APIs in order to have the paperwork sent automatically
Deploy with real life test user (Already sourced)


**What tools, systems or datasets are involved?**

Will explore more tools as the project gets underway but current plan is to use ChatGPT API or equivalent LLM along with python flask along with mail sending third party APIs.
Data will be user generated. I will also be interfacing with public criminal databases to pull in additional information.

**What is the expected outcome?**

The expected outcome is a tool that streamlines the legal expungement process.

**How are you going to evaluate your work?**

Was a tool created that my lawyer partner intends to use. Does using this tool save more than 30% of the total time it would take to do these.

**Programming Language**
Python

**Workload Justification**
This is a meaty project that I expect to take 2 full working weeks (80+ hours). At least half of this work will be in the requirements gathering and QA process, but I expect there will be plenty of coding time stringing everything together and engineering the text to get the desired result.

I am thankful for the opportunity to pursue this side project as part of the final project for this class. I expect that it will be a key portfolio piece as I search for a job after I graduate this semester.
